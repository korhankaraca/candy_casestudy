# In this study, fruit based and chocolate based candies were compared. 

The analysis has been done by creating a split at %50 winning chance. As described in the above link, 
candidates were asked to choose between two candies. Thus, a %50 chance is the random winning chance. A chance above 
%50 tells us that there is a tendency for winnig.
